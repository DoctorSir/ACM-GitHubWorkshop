# ACM-GitHubWorkshop

Welcome to the ACM Github Workshop! In this workshop, we will be teaching you about the basic Git commands that you can use to manage your codebase. We will also guide you through the process of contributing to an open source project hosted on Github.

## Getting Started
### Fork the project
To get started, you will need to fork this repository by clicking the Fork button at the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your own Github account, which you can then modify without affecting the original repository.

### Clone the project
Once you have forked the repository, you will need to clone it to your local machine. To do this, open a terminal window and run the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/ACM-GithubWorkshop.git```
Make sure to replace "your-username" with your actual Github username.

### Make a folder with your name
Navigate to the `members` folder in the project and create a new folder with your name. This folder will be used to store your personal website.

### Create your personal website
Inside the folder you just created, create an `index.html` file and write a short bio about yourself. You can include any information you like, such as your hobbies, interests, or programming skills. Be creative and have fun!

###Make a pull request
Once you have finished creating your personal website, you can submit your changes back to the original repository by making a pull request. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Commit your changes by running the following command:
`
git add .
git commit -m "Added my personal website"
`

2. Push your changes to your forked repository by running the following command:
`
git push origin main
`

3. Finally, open a pull request by clicking the `New pull request` button on the original repository's Github page. Make sure to select your forked repository as the `head repository` and the original repository as the `base repository`. Once you have filled out the necessary information, click the `Create pull request` button to submit your changes for review.


### Conclusion
Congratulations! You have now learned how to contribute to an open source project hosted on Github. We hope you found this workshop useful and that you continue to explore the exciting world of Git and Github. Happy coding!
